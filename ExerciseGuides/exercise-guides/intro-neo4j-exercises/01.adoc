== Exercise 1: Retrieving Nodes (Preparations)

Make sure you have the Movie database, which contains 171 nodes and 253 relationships.

This is what you should see when you click the database icon:

If your database does not have this number of nodes and relationships, you can use the script below to reset it:

[source,cypher]
----
include::scripts/initialDatabase.cypher[]
----


== Exercise 1: Retrieving Nodes (Overview)

In this exercise, you will perform some basic retrievals from the Movie database.

* *Exercise 1.1*: Retrieve all nodes from the database.
* *Exercise 1.2*: Examine the data model for the graph.
* *Exercise 1.3*: Retrieve all _Person_ nodes.
* *Exercise 1.4*: Retrieve all _Movie_ nodes.

Go to the next page to start this exercise.

== Exercise 1.1: Retrieve all nodes from the database (Instructions)

*Write a query to retrieve _all_ nodes from the database.*

. Write the query in the query pane at the top of Neo4j Browser.
. Click the _Run_ button image:{guides}/img/run-button.png[] in order to execute the code.

== Exercise 1.1: Retrieve all nodes from the database (Solution)


*Write a query to retrieve _all_ nodes from the database.*

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (n) RETURN n 
----

You should now see all nodes in the graph in the result pane.
In this query, _n_ is a variable, which is a container that holds the result.

The result returned should be:

[.thumb]
image::{guides}/img/ReturnAllNode.png[ReturnAllNode,width=250]

++++
<div style="clear: both;"></div>

++++
*Notes:* 

* If the nodes displayed are not connected, make sure that _Connect result nodes_ is selected in your Neo4j Browser settings.
* If no nodes are returned, then perhaps you did not load the _Movie_ database (see _Preparations_).

== Exercise 1.2: Examine the data model for the graph (Instructions)

*Write a query to display the _schema_ of your database.*


== Exercise 1.2: Examine the data model for the graph (Solution)

*Write a query to display the _schema_ of your database.*

[source, cypher]
----
CALL db.schema.visualization()
----

The result returned should be:

[.thumb]
image::{guides}/img/call_db.schema.png[call_db.schema,width=600]

== Exercise 1.3: Retrieve all _Person_ nodes (Instructions)

*Write a query to retrieve all _Person_ nodes.*

== Exercise 1.3: Retrieve all _Person_ nodes (Solution)

*Write a query to retrieve all _Person_ nodes.*

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person) RETURN p 
----

The result returned should be:

[.thumb]
image::{guides}/img/PersonNodes.png[PersonNodes,width=600]

++++
<div style="clear: both;"></div>

++++

Here we use _p_ as the variable representing all nodes retrieved and what is returned for the query.
Notice also, that no relationships are displayed.
That is because most _Person_ nodes have no relationships with other _Person_ nodes.

== Exercise 1.4: Retrieve all _Movie_ nodes (Instructions)

*Write a query to retrieve all _Movie_ nodes.*

== Exercise 1.4: Retrieve all _Movie_ nodes (Solution)

*Write a query to retrieve all _Movie_ nodes.*

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie) RETURN m
----

The result returned should be:

[.thumb]
image::{guides}/img/MovieNodes.png[MovieNodes,width=600]

++++
<div style="clear: both;"></div>
++++

Here we use _m_ as the variable representing all nodes retrieved and what is returned for the query.
Notice also, that no relationships are displayed.
That is because a _Movie_ node has no relationships with another _Movie_ node.

== Exercise 1: Retrieving Nodes (Summary)


In this exercise, you performed some basic retrievals from the Movie database.
You also called the method to examine the schema of the graph.
