== Exercise 10: Creating Relationships (Preparations)

Make sure you have the Movie database, which contains 173 nodes and 253 relationships.

This is what you should see when you click the database icon:

If your database does not have this number of nodes and relationships, you can use the script below to reset it:

== Exercise 10: Creating Relationships (Overview)

In the previous exercise, you created nodes, added and removed both properties and labels from nodes.
The connections between nodes, the relationships, are one of the most important parts of a Neo4j graph.

In this exercise you will create relationships between nodes.
Then you will add properties to relationships.
Finally, you will remove properties from relationships.

* *Exercise 10.1*: Create _ACTED_IN_ relationships.
* *Exercise 10.2*: Create a _DIRECTED_ relationship.
* *Exercise 10.3*: Create a _HELPED_ relationship.
* *Exercise 10.4*: Query nodes and new relationships.
* *Exercise 10.5*: Add properties to relationships.
* *Exercise 10.6*: Add a property to the _HELPED_ relationship.
* *Exercise 10.7*: View the current list of property keys in the graph.
* *Exercise 10.8*: View the current schema of the graph.
* *Exercise 10.9*: Retrieve the names and roles for actors.
* *Exercise 10.10*: Retrieve information about any specific relationships.
* *Exercise 10.11*: Modify a property of a relationship.
* *Exercise 10.12*: Remove a property from a relationship.
* *Exercise 10.13*: Confirm that your modifications were made to the graph.

== Exercise 10.1: Create _ACTED_IN_ relationships (Instructions)

In the last exercise, you created the node for the movie, _Forrest Gump_ and the person, _Robin Wright_.

*Create the _ACTED_IN_ relationship between the actors, _Robin Wright_, _Tom Hanks_, and _Gary Sinise_ and the movie, _Forrest Gump_.*

== Exercise 10.1: Create _ACTED_IN_ relationships (Solution)

*Create the _ACTED_IN_ relationship between the actors, _Robin Wright_, _Tom Hanks_, and _Gary Sinise_ and the movie, _Forrest Gump_.*

MATCH (m:Movie) 
WHERE m.title = 'Forrest Gump'
MATCH (p:Person)
WHERE p.name = 'Tom Hanks' OR p.name = 'Robin Wright' OR p.name = 'Gary Sinise'
CREATE (p)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m)

== Exercise 10.4: Query nodes and new relationships (Instructions)

*Write a Cypher query to return all nodes connected to the movie, _Forrest Gump_, along with their relationships.*

== Exercise 10.4: Query nodes and new relationships (Solution)

*Write a Cypher query to return all nodes connected to the movie, _Forrest Gump_, along with their relationships.*

Notice here that the _HELPED_ relationship is also shown because _Tom Hanks_ and _Gary Sinise_ are connected and we have _Connect result nodes_ selected in our Neo4j Browser settings.

== Exercise 10.5: Add properties to relationships (Instructions)

Next, you will add some properties to the relationships that you just created.

*Add the _roles_ property to the three _ACTED_IN_ relationships that you just created to the movie, _Forrest Gump_ using this information:*
*_Tom Hanks_ played the role, _Forrest Gump_.*
*_Robin Wright_ played the role, _Jenny Curran_.*
*_Gary Sinise_ played the role, _Lieutenant Dan Taylor_.*

*Hint:* You can set each relationship using separate `MATCH` clauses.
You can also use a `CASE` clause to set the values.
Look up in the documentation for how to use the `CASE` clause.

== Exercise 10.5: Add properties to relationships (Solution)

*Add the _roles_ property to the three _ACTED_IN_ relationships that you just created to the movie, _Forrest Gump_ using this information:*
*_Tom Hanks_ played the role, _Forrest Gump_.*
*_Robin Wright_ played the role, _Jenny Curran_.*
*_Gary Sinise_ played the role, _Lieutenant Dan Taylor_.*

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[rel:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
WHERE m.title = 'Forrest Gump'
SET rel.roles = 
CASE p.name
  WHEN 'Tom Hanks' THEN ['Forrest Gump']
  WHEN 'Robin Wright' THEN ['Jenny Curran']
  WHEN 'Gary Sinise' THEN ['Lieutenant Dan Taylor']
END

== Exercise 10.6: Add a property to the _HELPED_ relationship (Instructions)

*Add a new property, _research_ to the _HELPED_ relationship between _Tom Hanks_ and _Gary Sinise_ and set this property's value to _war history_.*

== Exercise 10.6: Add a property to the _HELPED_ relationship (Solution)

*Add a new property, _research_ to the _HELPED_ relationship between _Tom Hanks_ and _Gary Sinise_ and set this property's value to _war history_.*

Notice here that 2 results are returned.
That is because we did not specify a direction for the relationship in the query.
So there is a relationship from _Tom Hanks_ and also to _Gary Sinise_, even though there is only one physical relationship in the graph.
If you specify a direction for the relationship, only one result is returned.

== Exercise 10.11: Modify a property of a relationship (Instructions)

Next, you will modify existing properties for a relationship and also remove them.

*Modify the _role_ that _Gary Sinise_ played in the movie, _Forrest Gump_ from _Lieutenant Dan Taylor_ to _Lt. Dan Taylor_.*

== Exercise 10: Creating Relationships (Taking it further - optional)

* Try adding or updating properties using the JSON-style syntax using `=` and `+=`.
