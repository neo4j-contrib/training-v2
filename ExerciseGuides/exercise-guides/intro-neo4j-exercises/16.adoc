== Exercise 16: Importing data (Preparations)


If you are using Neo4j Desktop:

You will start with a new database named importcsv. Execute these commands in Neo4j Browser to create the database.
[source, cypher]
----
:USE system
CREATE DATABASE importcsv
:USE importcsv
----

If you are using Neo4j Sandbox or Neo4j Aura, you will need to:

. Drop all indexes and constraints in the graph.
. Execute `MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n`

== Exercise 16: Importing data (Overview)

In this exercise you write Cypher statements to import data into your graph.

* *Exercise 16.1*: Write the Cypher statement to read the actor data from a file.
* *Exercise 16.2*: Read the data and return it, ensuring that the data returned is properly formatted.
* *Exercise 16.3*: Load the data into your graph.
* *Exercise 16.4*: Write the Cypher statement to read the movie data from a file.
* *Exercise 16.5*: Read the data and return it, ensuring that the data returned is properly formatted.
* *Exercise 16.6*: Load the data into your graph.
* *Exercise 16.7*: Write the Cypher statement to read the relationship data from a file.
* *Exercise 16.8*: Read the data and return it, ensuring that the data returned is properly formatted.
* *Exercise 16.9*: Load the data into your graph.

== Exercise 16.1: Write the Cypher statement to read the actor data from a file (Instructions)

You are given the name of a file, http://data.neo4j.com/v4.0-intro-neo4j/actors.csv that you must load into your graph.

*Write the Cypher statement to read the actor data from this file.*

*Note:* If you have previously downloaded the files for this course and are using Neo4j Desktop, you can place them into the *import* folder:

. In Neo4j Desktop Click *Manage > Open Folder* for the Neo4j instance you are using.
. Copy the CSV files you previously downloaded to the *import* folder.
. Adapt the code above to read from the filesystem:
