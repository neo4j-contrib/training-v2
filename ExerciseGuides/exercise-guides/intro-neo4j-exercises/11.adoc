== Exercise 11: Deleting Nodes and Relationships (Overview)

In the previous exercise, you created relationships between _Person_ and _Movie_ nodes and you modified the properties for these relationships.

In this exercise you will delete nodes and relationships from the graph.

* *Exercise 11.1*: Delete a relationship.
* *Exercise 11.2*: Confirm that the relationship has been deleted.
* *Exercise 11.3*: Retrieve a movie and all of its relationships.
* *Exercise 11.4*: Try deleting a node without detaching its relationships.
* *Exercise 11.5*: Delete a _Movie_ node, along with its relationships.
* *Exercise 11.6*: Confirm that the _Movie_ node has been deleted.
