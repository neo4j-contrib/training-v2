== Exercise 8: Controlling results returned (Preparations)

Make sure you have the Movie database, which contains 171 nodes and 253 relationships.

This is what you should see when you click the database icon:

If your database does not have this number of nodes and relationships, you can use the script below to reset it:

== Exercise 8: Controlling results returned (Overview)

In the previous exercise, you wrote queries chain intermediate results using the `WITH` clause.

In this exercise, you will write queries where you can customize what results are returned and if they will be sorted.
First, you will write a query that eliminates duplication of rows returned.
Then you write a query that sorts the data returned.
Finally, you will write a query to limit the number of results returned.

* *Exercise 8.1*: Execute a query that returns duplicate records.
* *Exercise 8.2*: Modify the query to eliminate duplication.
* *Exercise 8.3*: Modify the query to eliminate more duplication.
* *Exercise 8.4*: Sort results returned.
* *Exercise 8.5*: Retrieve the top 5 ratings and their associated movies.

== Exercise 8.1: Execute a query that returns duplicate records. (Instructions)

*You want to know what actors acted in movies in the decade starting with the year 1990. First write a query to retrieve all actors that acted in movies during the 1990s, where you return the released date, the movie title, and the collected actor names for the movie. For now do not worry about duplication.*

MATCH (a:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)
WHERE m.released >= 1990 AND m.released < 2000
RETURN m.released, m.title, collect(a.name)

The result returned should be:

== Exercise 8.2: Modify the query to eliminate duplication (Instructions)

*The results returned from the previous query include multiple rows for a movie released value. Next, modify the query so that the released date records returned are not duplicated. To implement this, you must add the collection of the movie titles to the results returned.*

The result returned should be:

== Exercise 8.3: Modify the query to eliminate more duplication. (Instructions)

*The results returned from the previous query returns the collection of movie titles with duplicates. That is because there are multiple actors per released year. Next, modify the query so that there is no duplication of the movies listed for a year.*

== Exercise 8.3: Modify the query to eliminate more duplication. (Solution)

*The results returned from the previous query returns the collection of movie titles with duplicates. That is because there are multiple actors per released year. Next, modify the query so that there is no duplication of the movies listed for a year.*

MATCH (a:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)

RETURN  m.released, collect(DISTINCT m.title), collect(a.name)
----

The result returned should be:

== Exercise 8.4: Sort results returned (Instructions)

*Modify the query that you just wrote to order the results returned so that the more recent years are displayed first.*

*Modify the query that you just wrote to order the results returned so that the more recent years are displayed first.*

ORDER BY m.released DESC

The result returned should be:

== Exercise 8.5: Retrieve the top 5 ratings and their associated movies (Instructions)

Next you will limit the number of results returned.

*Retrieve the top 5 ratings and their associated movies, returning the movie title and the rating.*

== Exercise 8.5: Retrieve the top 5 ratings and their associated movies (Solution)

*Retrieve the top 5 ratings and their associated movies, returning the movie title and the rating.*

MATCH (:Person)-[r:REVIEWED]->(m:Movie)
RETURN  m.title AS movie, r.rating AS rating
ORDER BY r.rating DESC LIMIT 5
----

The result returned should be:

== Exercise 8: Controlling results returned (Summary)

In this exercise, you wrote queries where you can customize what results are returned and if they will be sorted.
First, you wrote a query that eliminates duplication of rows returned.
Then you wrote a query that sorts the data returned.
Finally, you wrote a query to limit the number of results returned.
