== Exercise 19: Importing data from an RDBMS using an application (Preparations)

If you are using Neo4j Desktop:

You will start with a new database named products. Execute these commands in Neo4j Browser to create the database.
[source, cypher]
----
:USE system
CREATE DATABASE products
:USE products
----

If you are using Neo4j Sandbox or Neo4j Aura, you will need to:

. Drop all indexes and constraints in the graph.
. Execute `MATCH (n) DETACH DELETE n`

== Exercise 19: Importing data with an application (Overview)

In this exercise you install the sdk and groovy frameworks for running the java-based application.
Next, you run the application that connects to the northwind RDBMS and copies data into the Neo4j database.
Finally, you confirm that the data has been created in the Neo4j database.

* *Exercise 19.1*: Install *sdkman*.
* *Exercise 19.2*: Install *groovy*.
* *Exercise 19.3*: Modify the groovy file to use the Neo4j RDBMS credentials.
* *Exercise 19.4*: Run the application to import the data.
* *Exercise 19.5*: View the database after import.

Go to the next page to start this exercise.

== Exercise 19.1: Install sdk (Instructions/Solution)

If you have already installed *sdkman* on your system, skip this step.

In a terminal window on OS X or Linux, follow these steps to install *sdk* on your system:

. Type: curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
. Type: source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
. Verify the installation by typing: *sdk help*.

*Note*: If you have a Windows system, you will need to install sdkman using a number of steps that are shown in this video:

== Exercise 19.2: Install groovy (Instructions/Solution)

If you have already installed *groovy* on your system, skip this step.

In the same terminal window, follow these steps to install groovy on your system:

. Type: sdk install groovy
. Verify the installation by typing: groovy -h

== Exercise 19.3: Modify the groovy file to use the Neo4j RDBMS credentials (Instructions/Solution)

. Here is the *import.groovy* file that you should place somewhere on your system:
+
[source]
----
@GrabConfig( systemClassLoader=true )
@Grapes([
  @Grab(group='org.postgresql', module='postgresql', version='42.0.0'),
  @Grab(group='org.neo4j.driver', module='neo4j-java-driver', version='4.0.0')
])

import org.neo4j.driver.*;
import java.sql.*;
Class.forName("org.postgresql.Driver");

table = "products";
JDBC = [url:"jdbc:postgresql://db-examples.cmlvojdj5cci.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com/northwind", user:"n4examples", pass:"36gdOVABr3Ex"];
NEO4J=[url:"bolt://localhost:7687", user:"neo4j",pass:"training-helps"];

// see https://neo4j.com/docs/api/java-driver/current/
GraphDatabase.driver(NEO4J.url, AuthTokens.basic(NEO4J.user, NEO4J.pass)).withCloseable{ neo4j ->
DriverManager.getConnection(JDBC.url, JDBC.user, JDBC.pass).withCloseable { rdbms ->

stmt = rdbms.prepareStatement("SELECT * FROM ${table}");

neo4j.session(SessionConfig.builder().withDatabase("products").build()).withCloseable{ session ->
  session.writeTransaction { tx ->
   stmt.executeQuery().withCloseable{ rs ->
     meta = rs.getMetaData();
     cols = meta.getColumnCount();
     while (rs.next()) {
        params = [:];
        for (int i=0;i<cols;i++) {
           params[meta.getColumnName(i+1)]=rs.getObject(i+1);
        }
        println(params);
        tx.run("CREATE (n:${table}) SET n += \$props", Values.value([props:params])).consume();
     }
   }
}}}}

. Modify the NEO4J value to match the credentials you use to connect to the Neo4j database.

== Exercise 19.4: Run the application to load the data (Instructions/Solution)

In the same terminal window:

. Navigate to the folder where you placed the *import.groovy* file.

. Type: groovy import.groovy

You should see something like this:

== Exercise 19.5: View the database after import (Instructions/Solution)

In Neo4j Browser, confirm that the database was populated.

You should see this in Neo4j Browser:

== Exercise 19: Importing data from an RDBMS using an application (Summary)

In this exercise you install the sdk and groovy frameworks for running the java-based application.
Next, you run the application that connects to the northwind RDBMS and copies data into the Neo4j database.
Finally, you confirm that the data has been created in the Neo4j database.
