== Exercise 2: Filtering queries using property values (Preparations)

Make sure you have the Movie database, which contains 171 nodes and 253 relationships.

This is what you should see when you click the database icon:

If your database does not have this number of nodes and relationships, you can use the script below to reset it:

== Exercise 2: Filtering queries using property values (Overview)

Thus far, you have filtered what nodes are returned from a query based upon the `Label` for the node where you returned _Person_ or _Movie_ nodes.

In this exercise, you will retrieve nodes from the database by specifying a filter criteria that is a property value.
Then, you will examine the property keys in the training _Movie_ graph.
Finally, you will query the graph to return property values for nodes retrieved.

* *Exercise 2.1*: Retrieve all movies that were released in a specific year.
* *Exercise 2.2*: View the retrieved results as a table.
* *Exercise 2.3*: Query the database for all property keys.
* *Exercise 2.4*: Retrieve all Movies released in a specific year, returning their titles.
* *Exercise 2.5*: Display _title_, _released_, and _tagline_ values for every _Movie_ node in the graph.
* *Exercise 2.6*: Display more user-friendly headers in the table.

== Exercise 2.1: Retrieve all movies that were released in a specific year (Instructions)

*Retrieve all _Movie_ nodes that have a _released_ property value of 2003.*

== Exercise 2.1: Retrieve all movies that were released in a specific year (Solution)

*Retrieve all _Movie_ nodes that have a _released_ property value of 2003.*

----
MATCH (m:Movie {released:2003}) RETURN m
----

The result returned should be:

== Exercise 2.2: View the retrieved results as a table (Instructions)

*View the results you just viewed in Neo4j Browser as a table.*

== Exercise 2.2: View the retrieved results as a table (Solution)

*View the results you just viewed in Neo4j Browser as a table.*

In the result pane, click the table icon in the left panel.
You should see this table in the result pane:

== Exercise 2.2: View the retrieved results as a table (Taking it further - optional)

** Retrieve all movie nodes in the database and view the data as a table.
Notice the values for the released property for each node.
** Try querying the graph using different years.


== Exercise 2.3: Query the database for all property keys (Instructions)

You want to know the existing property keys used in a graph.
This will help you to write Cypher queries that utilizes property keys for filtering data or for returning data.

*Query the database for all property keys.*

== Exercise 2.3: Query the database for all property keys (Solution)

*Query the database for all property keys.*

In the query editor pane, enter the Cypher query to retrieve the property keys from the database.

[source, cypher]
----
CALL db.propertyKeys()
----

The result returned should be:

== Exercise 2.4: Retrieve all Movies released in a specific year, returning their titles (Instructions)

Rather than returning the nodes that satisfy a query, you want to return data from the nodes.

*Retrieve all Movies released in 2006, returning their titles.*

== Exercise 2.4: Retrieve all Movies released in a specific year, returning their titles (Solution)

*Retrieve all Movies released in 2006, returning their titles.*

In the query editor pane, enter the Cypher query to retrieve all _Movie_ nodes from the database with a _released_ value of _2006_, but rather than returning the nodes, return the _title_ values for all nodes retrieved.

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie {released: 2006}) RETURN m.title
----

The result returned should be:

[.thumb]
image::{guides}/img/MoviesReleased2006_titles.png[MoviesReleased2006_titles,width=500]

== Exercise 2.4: Retrieve all Movies released in a specific year, returning their titles (Taking it further - optional)

* Retrieve all _Movie_ nodes and view them as a table. Observe the properties that _Movie_ nodes have.
* Query the database using a different year and also return more property values.


== Exercise 2.5: Display _title_, _released_, and _tagline_ values for every _Movie_ node in the graph (Instructions)

When you start working with a graph, it is sometimes helpful to simply view property values.
This can sometimes help to inform you about future queries you may want to execute against the graph.

*Retrieve all _Movie_ nodes from the database and return the _title_, _released_, and _tagline_ values.*

== Exercise 2.5: Display _title_, _released_, and _tagline_ values for every _Movie_ node in the graph (Solution)

*Retrieve all _Movie_ nodes from the database and return the _title_, _released_, and _tagline_ values.*

In the query editor pane, enter the Cypher query to retrieve all _Movie_ nodes from the database and write _title_, _released_, and _tagline_ values.

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie) RETURN m.title, m.released, m.tagline
----

The result returned should be:

== Exercise 2.6: Display more user-friendly headers in the table (Instructions)

*Modify the query you just ran so that the headings for the columns of the table returned are more descriptive.*

== Exercise 2.6: Display more user-friendly headers in the table (Solution)

*Modify the query you just ran so that the headings for the columns of the table returned are more descriptive.*

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie) RETURN m.title AS `movie title`, m.released AS released, m.tagline AS tagLine
----

The result returned should be:

== Exercise 2: Filtering queries using property values (Summary)

In this exercise, you retrieved nodes from the database by specifying a filter criteria that is a property value.
Then, you examined the property keys in the training _Movie_ graph.
Finally, you queried the graph to return property values for nodes retrieved.
