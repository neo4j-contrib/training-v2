== Exercise 3: Filtering queries using relationships (Preparations)

Make sure you have the Movie database, which contains 171 nodes and 253 relationships.

This is what you should see when you click the database icon:

If your database does not have this number of nodes and relationships, you can use the script below to reset it:

== Exercise 3: Filtering queries using relationships (Overview)

In the previous exercise, you have filtered what nodes and properties are returned from a query based upon a value of a property for a node.

In this exercise, you will write queries that filter the nodes and property values that are returned based upon the relationships between nodes.
You will first use an anonymous node to specify a filter based upon a node's specific relationship to other nodes.
Then you will write a query that selects data based upon any relationship between nodes.
Next, you will write a Cypher query to return information about the relationships between nodes.
Finally, you will write a query to return property values for the relationships between nodes.

* *Exercise 3.1:* Display the schema of the database.
* *Exercise 3.2*: Retrieve all people who wrote the movie _Speed Racer_.
* *Exercise 3.3*: Retrieve all movies that are connected to the person, _Tom Hanks_.
* *Exercise 3.4:* Retrieve information about the relationships _Tom Hanks_ had with the set of movies retrieved earlier.
* *Exercise 3.5:* Retrieve information about the roles that _Tom Hanks_ acted in.

== Exercise 3.1: Display the schema of the database (Instructions)

You will use schema information to help you specify relationships in your queries.

*Display the schema of the database.*


== Exercise 3.1: Display the schema of the database (Solution)

*Display the schema of the database.*

CALL db.schema.visualization()

The result returned should be:

== Exercise 3.2: Retrieve all people who wrote the movie _Speed Racer_ (Instructions)

*Retrieve all people who wrote the movie _Speed Racer_.*

== Exercise 3.2: Retrieve all people who wrote the movie _Speed Racer_ (Solution)

*Retrieve all people who wrote the movie _Speed Racer_.*

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)-[:WROTE]->(:Movie {title: 'Speed Racer'}) RETURN p.name
----

The result returned should be:

Notice here that the _:Movie_ node is an anonymous node because for the query, we do not need information about the _Movie_ node.

== Exercise 3.2: Retrieve all people who wrote the movie _Speed Racer_ (Taking it further - optional)

* Retrieve all people who have written other movies.
* Retrieve people who have acted in a particular movie.
* Retrieve people who have directed a particular movie.

== Exercise 3.3: Retrieve all movies that are connected to the person, _Tom Hanks_ (Instructions)

*Retrieve all movies connected with _Tom Hanks_.*

*Hint:* _Tom Hanks_ has multiple relationships with a movie so you should not specify a relationship type in the query.


== Exercise 3.3: Retrieve all movies that are connected to the person, _Tom Hanks_ (Solution)

*Retrieve all movies connected with _Tom Hanks_.*

*Hint:* _Tom Hanks_ has multiple relationships with a movie so you should not specify a relationship type in the query.

In the query editor pane, enter the Cypher query to retrieve all movies that are connected to _Tom Hanks_.

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)<--(:Person {name: 'Tom Hanks'}) RETURN m.title
----

The result returned should be:

image::{guides}/img/TomHanksMovies.png[TomHanksMovies,width=400]



Notice that _Tom Hanks_ has multiple relationships to the movie, "That Thing You Do".
Also notice that we specify the named node (with a variable) first.
It is a best practice to put named nodes first in a query.

== Exercise 3.3: Retrieve all movies that are connected to the person, _Tom Hanks_ (Taking it further - optional)

* Retrieve all movies connected with another actor.
* Retrieve all people connected with a particular movie.

== Exercise 3.4: Retrieve information about the relationships _Tom Hanks_ has with the set of movies retrieved earlier (Instructions)

*Modify the query that you just executed to return the type information about the relationships between _Tom Hanks_ and the movies.*

== Exercise 3.4: Retrieve information about the relationships _Tom Hanks_ has with the set of movies retrieved earlier (Solution)

*Modify the query that you just executed to return the type information about the relationships between _Tom Hanks_ and the movies.*

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)-[rel]-(:Person {name: 'Tom Hanks'}) RETURN m.title, type(rel)

The result returned should be:

== Exercise 3.4: Retrieve information about the relationships _Tom Hanks_ has with the set of movies retrieved earlier (Taking it further - optional)

* Retrieve the relationship information about a different actor.

== Exercise 3.5: Retrieve information about the roles that _Tom Hanks_ acted in (Instructions)

As an actor, a _Person_ node in the database connects to a _Movie_ node using the _ACTED_IN_ relationship.
One of the properties of the _ACTED_IN_ relationship is _roles_.

*Retrieve information about the roles that _Tom Hanks_ played.*

== Exercise 3.5: Retrieve information about the roles that _Tom Hanks_ acted in (Solution)

*Retrieve information about the roles that _Tom Hanks_ played.*

Write and execute the Cypher query to retrieve all of the roles that _Tom Hanks_ acted in.

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (m:Movie)-[rel:ACTED_IN]-(:Person {name: 'Tom Hanks'}) RETURN m.title, rel.roles

The result returned should be:

== Exercise 3.5: Retrieve information about the roles that _Tom Hanks_ acted in (Taking it further - optional)

* Retrieve all roles for a different actor.
* Retrieve all roles played for a particular movie.


== Exercise 3: Filtering queries using relationships (Summary)

In this exercise, you wrote queries that filter the nodes and property values that are returned based upon the relationships between nodes.
You first used an anonymous node to specify a filter based upon a node's specific relationship to other nodes.
Then you wrote a query that selects data based upon any relationship between nodes.
Next, you wrote a Cypher query to return information about the relationships between nodes.
Finally, you wrote a query to return property values for the relationships between nodes.
