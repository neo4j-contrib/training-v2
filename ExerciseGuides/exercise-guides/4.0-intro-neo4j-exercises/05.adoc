== Exercise 5: Working with patterns in queries (Preparations)

Make sure you have the Movie database, which contains 171 nodes and 253 relationships.

This is what you should see when you click the database icon:

If your database does not have this number of nodes and relationships, you can use the script below to reset it:

== Exercise 5: Working with patterns in queries (Overview)

In the previous exercise, you have filtered your queries using the `WHERE` clause of a Cypher query.

In this exercise, you will write queries that filter the results that are returned using a `WHERE` clause as well as performing some additional processing during the query.
First, you will write a query where multiple patterns are required.
Then you write a query that uses a variable length pattern to retrieve data.
Finally, you will write a query that retrieves data with optional results.

* *Exercise 5.1*: Retrieve data using multiple `MATCH` patterns.
* *Exercise 5.2*: Retrieve particular nodes that have a relationship.
* *Exercise 5.3*: Modify the query to retrieve nodes that are exactly three hops away.
* *Exercise 5.4*: Modify the query to retrieve nodes that are one and two hops away.
* *Exercise 5.5*: Modify the query to retrieve particular nodes that are connected no matter how many hops are required.
* *Exercise 5.6*: Specify optional data to be retrieved during the query.

== Exercise 5.1: Retrieve data using multiple `MATCH` patterns (Instructions)

*Write a Cypher query that retrieves all movies that _Gene Hackman_ has acted it, along with the directors of the movies. In addition, retrieve the actors that acted in the same movies as _Gene Hackman_. Return the name of the movie, the name of the director, and the names of actors that worked with _Gene Hackman_.*


== Exercise 5.1: Retrieve data using multiple `MATCH` patterns (Solution)

*Write a Cypher query that retrieves all movies that _Gene Hackman_ has acted it, along with the directors of the movies. In addition, retrieve the actors that acted in the same movies as _Gene Hackman_. Return the name of the movie, the name of the director, and the names of actors that worked with _Gene Hackman_.*

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (a:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)<-[:DIRECTED]-(d:Person),
      (a2:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m)
WHERE a.name = 'Gene Hackman'
RETURN m.title as movie, d.name AS director , a2.name AS `co-actors`
----

The result returned should be:

== Exercise 5.2: Retrieve particular nodes that have a relationship (Instructions)

Next, you will perform queries for data that is a variable number of hops away.

Write this Cypher query to explore the graph engine's behavior with varying length paths for the _FOLLOWS_ relationship in the _Movie_ graph:

*Retrieve all nodes that the person named _James Thompson_ directly has the _FOLLOWS_ relationship in either direction.*

== Exercise 5.2: Retrieve particular nodes that have a relationship (Solution)

*Retrieve all nodes that the person named _James Thompson_ directly has the _FOLLOWS_ relationship in either direction.*

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p1:Person)-[:FOLLOWS]-(p2:Person)
WHERE p1.name = 'James Thompson'
RETURN p1, p2
----

The result returned should be:

== Exercise 5.3: Modify the query to retrieve nodes that are exactly three hops away (Instructions)

*Modify the query to retrieve nodes that are exactly three hops away.*

== Exercise 5.3: Modify the query to retrieve nodes that are exactly three hops away (Solution)

*Modify the query to retrieve nodes that are exactly three hops away.*

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p1:Person)-[:FOLLOWS*3]-(p2:Person)
WHERE p1.name = 'James Thompson'
RETURN p1, p2
----

The result returned should be:

Notice here that the relationships between the nodes are not displayed because _James Thompson_ is not connected to _Paul Blythe_.

== Exercise 5.4: Modify the query to retrieve nodes that are one and two hops away (Instructions)

*Modify the query to retrieve nodes that are one and two hops away.*

== Exercise 5.4: Modify the query to retrieve nodes that are one and two hops away (Solution)

*Modify the query to retrieve nodes that are one and two hops away.*

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p1:Person)-[:FOLLOWS*1..2]-(p2:Person)
WHERE p1.name = 'James Thompson'
RETURN p1, p2
----

The result returned should be:

== Exercise 5.5: Modify the query to retrieve particular nodes that are connected no matter how many hops are required (Instructions)

*Modify the query to retrieve all nodes that are connected to _James Thompson_ by a _Follows_ relationship no matter how many hops are required.*


== Exercise 5.5: Modify the query to retrieve particular nodes that are connected no matter how many hops are required (Solution)

*Modify the query to retrieve all nodes that are connected to _James Thompson_ by a _Follows_ relationship no matter how many hops are required.*

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p1:Person)-[:FOLLOWS*]-(p2:Person)
WHERE p1.name = 'James Thompson'
RETURN p1, p2

The result returned should be:

== Exercise 5.6: Specify optional data to be retrieved during the query (Instructions)

*Write a Cypher query to retrieve all people in the graph whose name begins with _Tom_ and optionally retrieve all people named _Tom_ who directed a movie.*

== Exercise 5.6: Specify optional data to be retrieved during the query (Solution)

*Write a Cypher query to retrieve all people in the graph whose name begins with _Tom_ and optionally retrieve all people named _Tom_ who directed a movie.*

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person)
WHERE p.name STARTS WITH 'Tom'
OPTIONAL MATCH (p)-[:DIRECTED]->(m:Movie)
RETURN p.name, m.title
----

The result returned should be:

== Exercise 5: Working with patterns in queries (Summary)

In this exercise, you wrote queries that filtered the results that are returned using a `WHERE` clause as well as performing some additional processing during the query.
First, you wrote a query where multiple patterns are required.
Then you wrote a query that uses a variable length pattern to retrieve data.
Finally, you wrote a query that retrieves data with optional results.
