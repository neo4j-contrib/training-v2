== Exercise 5: Controlling query processing (Preparations)

Make sure you have the Movie database, which contains 171 nodes and 253 relationships.

This is what you should see when you click the database icon:

If your database does not have this number of nodes and relationships, you can use the script below to reset it:

== Exercise 5: Controlling query processing (Overview)

In the previous exercise, you have filtered your queries using the `WHERE` clause of a Cypher query.

In this exercise, you will write queries that filter the results that are returned using a `WHERE` clause as well as performing some additional processing during the query.
First, you will write a query where multiple patterns are required.
Then you write a query that uses a variable length pattern to retrieve data.
Next, you will write a query that retrieves data with optional results.
Then you will collect results during a query to build a list.
Next, you count retrievals during the query.
Finally, you will perform intermediate processing during the query using a `WITH` clause.

* *Exercise 5.1*: Retrieve data using multiple `MATCH` patterns.
* *Exercise 5.2*: Retrieve particular nodes that have a relationship.
* *Exercise 5.3*: Modify the query to retrieve nodes that are exactly three hops away.
* *Exercise 5.4*: Modify the query to retrieve nodes that are one and two hops away.
* *Exercise 5.5*: Modify the query to retrieve particular nodes that are connected no matter how many hops are required.
* *Exercise 5.6*: Specify optional data to be retrieved during the query.
* *Exercise 5.7*: Retrieve nodes by collecting a list.
* *Exercise 5.9*: Retrieve nodes as lists and return data associated with the corresponding lists.
* *Exercise 5.10*: Retrieve nodes and their relationships as lists.
* *Exercise 5.11*: Retrieve the actors who have acted in exactly five movies.
* *Exercise 5.12*: Retrieve the movies that have at least 2 directors with other optional data.

== Exercise 5.1: Retrieve data using multiple `MATCH` patterns (Instructions)

*Write a Cypher query that retrieves all movies that _Gene Hackman_ has acted it, along with the directors of the movies. In addition, retrieve the actors that acted in the same movies as _Gene Hackman_. Return the name of the movie, the name of the director, and the names of actors that worked with _Gene Hackman_.*

In addition, retrieve the actors that acted in the same movies as _Gene Hackman_. Return the name of the movie, the name of the director, and the names of actors that worked with _Gene Hackman_.*

== Exercise 5.2: Retrieve particular nodes that have a relationship (Instructions)

Next, you will perform queries for data that is a variable number of hops away.

Write this Cypher query to explore the graph engine's behavior with varying length paths for the _FOLLOWS_ relationship in the _Movie_ graph:

*Retrieve all nodes that the person named _James Thompson_ directly has the _FOLLOWS_ relationship in either direction.*

In this exercise, you wrote queries that filtered the results that are returned using a `WHERE` clause as well as performing some additional processing during the query.
First, you wrote a query where multiple patterns are required.
