Welcome to _Browser Guides_!
This is the interface for performing exercises to this Neo4j course.
They are presented in the form of self-paced exercises.
Navigate through the exercises by pressing the forward button at the right of the window.

We start by walking you through some preparations and instructions.
If you have used Neo4j Browser Guides before, you can skip to the last page.


== Before you start

=== Ensure the database is started

If you are using Neo4j Desktop, ensure that the project you have selected for use with Neo4j Browser is connected to a database that is started.

If you are using a Neo4j Sandbox or Neo4j Aura, the Neo4j Browser is already connected to a started database.

=== Enable multi-statement query editor

. Click the Browser Settings button in the lower left side of Neo4j Browser image:{guides}/img/browser-settings-button.png[].
. Make sure that the _Enable multi statement query editor_ checkbox is selected: image:{guides}/img/enable-multi-statement-query-editor.png[]

=== Pin a window

It is useful to pin the Browser Guide to the top, so that it doesn't scroll down when you execute statements.
You do this by pressing the _pin_ button in the upper right corner of the page: image:{guides}/img/pin-button.png[]
Pressing it once more will _unpin_ the window again: image:{guides}/img/unpin-button.png[]. 

== About the exercises

=== Preparations before each exercise

Each exercise starts with a _Preparations_ page.
It shows you how to reset the database to the point it should be at to begin the exercise.
This is useful, for example, if you have made a mistake in one of the previous exercises, or if you have done some testing on your own that changes the database into something that does not match the instructions in the exercises.


=== Writing and executing queries

. Write the query in the query pane at the top of Neo4j Browser.
. Click the _Run_ button image:{guides}/img/run-button.png[width=25] in order to execute the code.


=== Using code blocks

Many of the exercises contain _code blocks_ with runnable code.
Follow these steps in order to run the code against your database:

. Click inside of the code block.
You will notice that the code is copied into the code pane at the top of Neo4j Browser.
. Click the _Run_ button image:{guides}/img/run-button.png[width=25] in order to execute the code.


=== "Taking it further"

Some exercises include optional sections called _Taking it further_.
These are extra exercises that you can complete if you have more time.
