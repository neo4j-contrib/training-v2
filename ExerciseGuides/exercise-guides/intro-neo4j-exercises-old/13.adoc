== Exercise 13: Analyzing and monitoring queries (Preparations)


Make sure you have the Movie database, which contains 173 nodes and 257 relationships.

This is what you should see when you click the database icon:

If your database does not have this number of nodes and relationships, you can use the script below to reset it:

== Exercise 13: Analyzing and monitoring queries (Overview)

In this exercise you will look at metrics for a query during query planning (`EXPLAIN`) and during query execution (`PROFILE`).
Then you will monitor a long-running query and kill it.

* *Exercise 13.1*: View the query plan for a Cypher statement.
* *Exercise 13.2*: View the metrics for the query when a statement executes.
* *Exercise 13.3*: Remove the labels from the nodes and relationships in the query and again view the metrics.
* *Exercise 13.4*: Open a second Neo4j Browser session. 
* *Exercise 13.5*: Execute a long-running query and monitor.
* *Exercise 13.6*: Execute another long-running query and monitor.
* *Exercise 13.7*: Kill a query.

== Exercise 13.1: View the query plan for a Cypher statement (Instructions)

For this Part of the exercise, you will use the query that you wrote previously using Cypher parameters.
It assumes that you have set the _year_ and _ratingValue_ Cypher parameters:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (r:Person)-[rel:REVIEWED]->(m:Movie)<-[:ACTED_IN]-(a:Person)
WHERE m.released = $year AND
      rel.rating > $ratingValue
RETURN  DISTINCT r.name, m.title, m.released, rel.rating, collect(a.name)
----

*View the query plan for this Cypher statement.*

== Exercise 13.1: View the query plan for a Cypher statement (Solution)

*View the query plan for this Cypher statement.*

[source, cypher]
----
EXPLAIN MATCH (r:Person)-[rel:REVIEWED]->(m:Movie)<-[:ACTED_IN]-(a:Person)
WHERE m.released = $year AND
      rel.rating > $ratingValue
RETURN  DISTINCT r.name, m.title, m.released, rel.rating, collect(a.name)
----

When the result returned should be:

++++
<div style="clear: both;"></div>
++++


== Exercise 13.2: View the metrics for the query when a statement executes (Instructions)

*View the metrics for the query when the previous statement executes.*

== Exercise 13.2: View the metrics for the query when a statement executes (Solution)

*View the metrics for the query when the previous statement executes.*

[source, cypher]
----
PROFILE MATCH (r:Person)-[rel:REVIEWED]->(m:Movie)<-[:ACTED_IN]-(a:Person)
WHERE m.released = $year AND
      rel.rating > $ratingValue
RETURN  DISTINCT r.name, m.title, m.released, rel.rating, collect(a.name)
----

The result returned should look something like this:

[.thumb]
image::{guides}/img/PROFILE.png[PROFILE,width=500]

++++
<div style="clear: both;"></div>
++++

== Exercise 13.3: Remove the labels from the nodes and relationships in the query and again view the metrics (Instructions)

*Remove the labels from the nodes and relationships in the query and again view the metrics. Compare the db hits from the previous version of the statement.*

== Exercise 13.3: Remove the labels from the nodes and relationships in the query and again view the metrics (Solution)

*Remove the labels from the nodes and relationships in the query and again view the metrics. Compare the db hits from the previous version of the statement.*

[source, cypher]
----
PROFILE MATCH (r)-[rel]->(m)<-[:ACTED_IN]-(a)
WHERE m.released = $year AND
      rel.rating > $ratingValue
RETURN  DISTINCT r.name, m.title, m.released, rel.rating, collect(a.name)
----

The result returned should be:

[.thumb]
image::{guides}/img/PROFILE2.png[PROFILE2,width=500]

You should see more db hits.
This is because you removed the labels that help to filter nodes and relationships during the query.

== Exercise 13.4: Open a second Neo4j Browser session (Instructions)

Recall that a query may run for a long time because:

* There are a lot of results to return
* The query takes a long time to execute in the graph engine.

You will perform these steps to gain some experience with monitoring and killing queries by having your original Neo4j Browser window open and then opening another Neo4j Browser window.

*Open a second Neo4j Browser session. This session will be used for monitoring queries as they run.*

== Exercise 13.4: Open a second Neo4j Browser session (Solution)

*Open a second Neo4j Browser session. This session will be used for monitoring queries as they run.*

If you are using Neo4j Desktop, open a Web browser window and enter http://localhost:7474 which opens a second Neo4j Browser window that has access to the same graph.

If you are using a Neo4j Sandbox, go the the Sandbox site and simply click on the Neo4j Browser to open a second window for that same graph.

== Exercise 13.5: Execute a long-running query and monitor (Instructions)

*Execute this long-running query in your original Neo4j Browser session that returns a lot of results. In the second Neo4j Browser window, monitor the running queries.* 

Here is a very bad Cypher statement to use that returns a lot of results:
[source, cypher]
----
PROFILE MATCH (a)--(b)--(c)--(d)--(e)--(f)--(g)
RETURN a
----

What do you see in the second Neo4j Browser window where you are monitoring queries?

== Exercise 13.5: Execute a long-running query and monitor (Solution)

*Execute this long-running query in your original Neo4j Browser session that returns a lot of results. In the second Neo4j Browser window, monitor the running queries.* 

Here is a very bad Cypher statement to use that returns a lot of results:
[source, cypher]
----
PROFILE MATCH (a)--(b)--(c)--(d)--(e)--(f)--(g)
RETURN a
----

What do you see in the second Neo4j Browser window where you are monitoring queries?

While the query in the original Neo4j Browser window is executing, you should see this in the second Neo4j Browser window:

[.thumb]
image::{guides}/img/LongRunningReturn.png[LongRunningReturn,width=600]

This is because the graph engine has completed the query and the results are being streamed.

== Exercise 13.6: Execute another long-running query and monitor (Instructions)

*Execute this long-running query in your original Neo4j Browser session and monitor the query in the second Neo4j Browser session.*

Here is a very bad Cypher statement that takes a lot of time to execute in the graph engine:

[source, cypher]
----
PROFILE MATCH (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) , (f), (g)
RETURN count(id(a))
----

What do you see in the second Neo4j Browser window where you are monitoring queries?

== Exercise 13.6: Execute another long-running query and monitor (Solution)

*Execute this long-running query in your original Neo4j Browser session and monitor the query in the second Neo4j Browser session.*

Here is a very bad Cypher statement that takes a lot of time to execute in the graph engine:

[source, cypher]
----
PROFILE MATCH (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) , (f), (g)
RETURN count(id(a))
----

What do you see in the second Neo4j Browser window where you are monitoring queries?

You should see this in the second Neo4j Browser window:

== Exercise 13.7: Kill a query (Instructions)

*In the second Neo4j Browser window, kill the long-running query.*

What do you see in the original Neo4j Browser window?

== Exercise 13.7: Kill a query (Solutions)

*In the second Neo4j Browser window, kill the long-running query.*

== Exercise 13: Analyzing and monitoring queries (Summary)

In this exercise you gained experience analyzing metrics for queries, monitoring queries, and killing queries.
