== Exercise 11: Merging Data in the Graph (Preparations)

Make sure you have the Movie database, which contains 172 nodes and 253 relationships.

This is what you should see when you click the database icon:

If your database does not have this number of nodes and relationships, you can use the script below to reset it:

== Exercise 11: Merging Data in the Graph (Overview)

You have gained experience creating, modifying, and deleting nodes and relationships.

In this exercise you will add and modify nodes and relationships in the graph by merging data.
In some parts of the exercise, you will be creating duplicate nodes and relationships.
You will see how in your real application, you should take care not to create duplicate nodes and relationships in your graphs.

== Exercise 11.1: Use `MERGE` to create a _Movie_ node (Instructions)

In this Part of the exercise, you will again create the movie, _Forrest Gump_, update the node, and then merge the data in the graph to create another node with a different label.

*Use `MERGE` to create (`ON CREATE`) a node of type _Movie_ with the _title_ property, _Forrest Gump_. If created,  set the _released_ property to  _1994_.*

== Exercise 11.1: Use `MERGE` to create a _Movie_ node (Solution)

*Use `MERGE` to create (`ON CREATE`) a node of type _Movie_ with the _title_ property, _Forrest Gump_. If created,  set the _released_ property to  _1994_.*

[source, cypher]
----
MERGE (m:Movie {title: 'Forrest Gump'})
ON CREATE SET m.released = 1994
RETURN m

== Exercise 11.7: Use `MERGE` to create two nodes and a single relationship (Instructions)

In this Part of the exercise, you merge data to create relationships.

*Execute the following Cypher statement that uses `MERGE` to create two nodes and a single relationship*

[source, cypher]
----
MERGE (p:Person {name: 'Robert Zemeckis'})-[:DIRECTED]->(m {title: 'Forrest Gump'})
----

This statement first finds all _Person_ nodes that have only the _name_ property value of _Robert Zemeckis_.
It then finds all nodes with only the _title_ property set to _Forrest Gump_.
There are no _Person_ or other nodes that have only these properties so the graph engine creates them.
Then the graph engine creates the relationship between these two nodes.
That is, this `MERGE` operation creates two nodes and a single relationship.
If we had provided all of the property values for the nodes, we would not have created the extra nodes.

In fact, you should *never* create nodes and relationships together like this! This example is here to show you how powerful Cypher can be.
A best practice is to create nodes first, then relationships.

== Exercise 11.8: Use the same `MERGE` statement to attempt to create two nodes and a single relationship (Instructions)

*Repeat the execution of the previous statement.*

It should do nothing.
A best practice is to always use `MERGE` to create relationships to ensure that there will be no duplication in the graph.

== Exercise 11.9: Find the correct _Person_ node to delete (Instructions)

*Find the correct _Person_ node to delete*

You query the nodes before you delete them to ensure you have the correct `MATCH` clauses.

Execute this query:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (p:Person {name: 'Robert Zemeckis'})-[rel]-(x)
WHERE NOT EXISTS (p.born)
RETURN p, rel, x
----
