== Exercise 4: Filtering queries using the `WHERE` clause (Preparations)

Make sure you have the Movie database, which contains 171 nodes and 253 relationships.

This is what you should see when you click the database icon:

If your database does not have this number of nodes and relationships, you can use the script below to reset it:

== Exercise 4: Filtering queries using the `WHERE` clause (Overview)

In the previous exercise, you have filtered your queries based upon node labels, property values, and relationships in a `MATCH` pattern.

In this exercise, you will write queries that filter the results that are returned using a `WHERE` clause.
First, you will write some queries that filter based upon property values.
Then you will specify node labels in the filter.
Next, you will test whether a property exists.
Then you will filter queries based upon string comparisons.
Next, you will write queries that filter based upon patterns in the graph.
Finally, you will test if property values are in a list.

* *Exercise 4.1*: Retrieve all movies that _Tom Cruise_ acted in.
* *Exercise 4.2*: Retrieve all people that were born in the 70's.
* *Exercise 4.3*: Retrieve the actors who acted in the movie _The Matrix_ who were born after 1960.
* *Exercise 4.4*: Retrieve all movies  by testing the node label and a property.
* *Exercise 4.5*: Retrieve all people that wrote movies by testing the relationship between two nodes.
* *Exercise 4.6*: Retrieve all people in the graph that do not have a property.
* *Exercise 4.7*: Retrieve all people related to movies where the relationship has a property.
* *Exercise 4.8*: Retrieve all actors whose name begins with _James_.
* *Exercise 4.9*: Retrieve all _REVIEW_ relationships from the graph with filtered results.
* *Exercise 4.10*: Retrieve all people who have produced a movie, but have not directed a movie.
* *Exercise 4.11*: Retrieve the movies and their actors where one of the actors also directed the movie.
* *Exercise 4.12*: Retrieve all movies that were released in a set of years.
* *Exercise 4.13*: Retrieve the movies that have an actor's role that is the name of the movie.
