== Exercise 6: Creating Nodes (Preparations)

Make sure you have the Movie database, which contains 171 nodes and 253 relationships.

This is what you should see when you click the database icon:

If your database does not have this number of nodes and relationships, you can use the script below to reset it:

== Exercise 6: Creating Nodes (Overview)

In the previous exercises, you have gained experience with Cypher queries.

In this exercise, you will write Cypher statements to create nodes.
Then you will write Cypher statements to add and remove labels for nodes.
Next, you will use Cypher to add properties to nodes.
Finally, you will write Cypher statements to remove properties from nodes.

* *Exercise 6.1*: Create a _Movie_ node.
* *Exercise 6.2*: Retrieve the newly-created node.
* *Exercise 6.3*: Create a _Person_ node.
* *Exercise 6.4*: Retrieve the newly-created node.
* *Exercise 6.5*: Add a label to a node.
* *Exercise 6.6*: Retrieve the node using the new label.
* *Exercise 6.7*: Add the _Female_ label to selected nodes.
* *Exercise 6.8*: Retrieve all _Female_ nodes.
* *Exercise 6.9*: Remove the _Female_ label from the nodes that have this label.
* *Exercise 6.10*: View the current schema of the graph.
* *Exercise 6.11*: Add properties to a movie.
* *Exercise 6.12*: Retrieve an _OlderMovie_ node to confirm the label and properties.
* *Exercise 6.13*: Add properties to the person, _Robin Wright_.
* *Exercise 6.14*: Retrieve an updated _Person_ node.
* *Exercise 6.15*: Remove a property from a _Movie_ node.
* *Exercise 6.16*: Retrieve the node to confirm that the property has been removed.
* *Exercise 6.17*: Remove a property from a _Person_ node.
* *Exercise 6.18*: Retrieve the node to confirm that the property has been removed.

== Exercise 6: Creating Nodes (Taking it further - optional)

* Add more labels to the _Movie_ nodes to reflect the movie genre (action, drama, etc.).
* Query the database using different labels for movies.
* Try adding or updating properties using the JSON-style syntax using `=` and `+=`.
* Add properties to nodes using the JSON-style format where you add all of the properties to the node.
* Query the database to confirm your additions.
* Call the Cypher built-in method to retrieve all of the property keys in the graph.


== Exercise 6: Creating Nodes (Summary)

In this exercise, you wrote Cypher statements to create nodes.
Then you wrote Cypher statements to add and remove labels for nodes.
Next, you used Cypher to add properties to nodes.
Finally, you wrote Cypher statements to remove properties from nodes.
