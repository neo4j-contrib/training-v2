== Exercise 3: Triangle Count (Preparations)

The database you start with should contain all of the data you loaded in the setup for this course.

This is what you should see when you click the database icon image:{guides}/img/database-icon.png[].

If you do not see this in your Neo4j Browser, you will need to perform the setup steps again.

== Exercise 3: Triangle Count (Overview)

In this exercise, you will gain some experience with writing Cypher to implement the Triangle count algorithm using the European Roads dataset.


* *Exercise 3.1*: Retrieve the triangles in the European Roads dataset.
* *Exercise 3.2*: Determine the triangle count and clustering coefficient for each *Place* node.
* *Exercise 3.3*: Verify results of the clustering coefficient.

== Exercise 3.1: Retrieve the triangles in the European Roads dataset. (Instructions)

Write a query to return the set of triangles in the graph between *Place* node using the *EROAD* relationship.

*Hint*: You will call `algo.triangle.stream`.

== Exercise 3.1: Retrieve the triangles in the European Roads dataset. (Solution)

Write a query to return the set of triangles in the graph between *Place* node using the *EROAD* relationship.

*Hint*: You will call `algo.triangle.stream`.

Here is the solution code:

[source, cypher]
----
CALL algo.triangle.stream("Place","EROAD")
YIELD nodeA, nodeB, nodeC
RETURN algo.getNodeById(nodeA).name AS nodeA,
       algo.getNodeById(nodeB).name AS nodeB,
       algo.getNodeById(nodeC).name AS nodeC
----

The results returned should look like this:

== Exercise 3.2: Determine the triangle count and clustering coefficient for each *Place* node. (Instructions)

Write a query to return the triangle count and clustering coefficient for each *Place* node using the *EROAD* relationship.

*Hint*: You will call `algo.triangleCount.stream`.

== Exercise 3.2: Determine the triangle count and clustering coefficient for each *Place* node. (Solution)

Write a query to return the triangle count and clustering coefficient for each *Place* node using the *EROAD* relationship.

*Hint*: You will call `algo.triangleCount.stream`.

Here is the solution code:

[source, cypher]
----
CALL algo.triangleCount.stream('Place', 'EROAD')
YIELD nodeId, triangles, coefficient
WHERE coefficient > 0
RETURN algo.getNodeById(nodeId).name AS place, coefficient, triangles
ORDER BY coefficient DESC
----

The results returned should look like this:

A score of 1 means that all the node's neighbors are connected to each other.

== Exercise 3.3: Verify results of the clustering coefficient. (Instructions)

Write a query to confirm that the clustering coefficient scores of 1 are correct.

== Exercise 3.3: Verify results of the clustering coefficient.  (Solution)

Write a query to confirm that the clustering coefficient scores of 1 are correct.

Here is the solution code for verifying the triangles for the *Bradford* node:

[source]
----
MATCH (p1:Place {name: "Bradford"})-[:EROAD]-(neighbor)
WITH p1, collect(neighbor) AS neighbors
UNWIND neighbors AS node1
UNWIND neighbors AS node2
OPTIONAL MATCH neighborPath = (node1)-[:EROAD]-(node2)
OPTIONAL MATCH nodePath = (node1)-[:EROAD]-(p1)-[:EROAD]-(node2)
RETURN neighborPath, nodePath
----

The results should be:

Check out other nodes with a clustering coefficient of 1.


== Exercise 3: Taking it further

. Write code to add the coefficient property to the *Place* nodes.
. Try using the non-stream version of the algorithms.

== Exercise 3: Triangle Count (Summary)

In this exercise, you gained some experience with writing Cypher to implement the Triangle count algorithm to return the triangle count and clustering coefficient for the *Place* nodes of  the European Roads dataset.
