== Set up your Development Environment

Before you perform the exercises for this course, complete the following steps:

Since these steps include downloading a *large* dataset, you *must* complete Steps 1-3  before you start this course.

*Step 1*: Prepare project for development.
{nbsp} +
{nbsp} +
*Step 2*: Verify libraries are available.
{nbsp} +
{nbsp} +
*Step 3*: Verify Graph Applications Playground (NEuler) is available.
{nbsp} +
{nbsp} +
The following steps can be completed after you have started the course during this exercise (Exercise 1):
{nbsp} +
{nbsp} +
*Step 4*: Use Graph Applications Playground (NEuler) to load some more data.
{nbsp} +
{nbsp} +
*Step 5*: Load some additional graphs used for the exercises.
{nbsp} +
{nbsp} +
Go to the next page to begin setup.

== Step 1: Prepare project for development.

. Download the Yelp dataset. (*Note*: This database is 1G and will take a while to download)
https://s3.amazonaws.com/neo4j-sandbox-usecase-datastores/v3_5/yelp.db.zip
. Unzip the zip file. It will create a *yelp.db* folder.
. In Neo4j Desktop, create a project and a local graph, providing a password you will remember.
{nbsp} +
    *Note*: Do *not* start the database!
    [start=3]
. Install the necessary plugins in the project.
.. Click *Add Plugin*.
.. Install the APOC plugin in the project.
.. Install the Graph Algorithms plugin  in the project.
. Install Graph Algorithms Playground (application) in the project.
.. Ensure that Graph Algorithms Playground is download in the graph apps settings area. (You may have to click Discover more graph apps to download it)
.. Click *Add Application*.
.. Select Graph Algorithms Playground.

This is what you should now see for your project:

image::{guides}/img/PluginsAppInstalled.png[PluginsAppInstalled,width=150,role=left]

[start = 6]
. Copy the *yelp.db* folder to your local graph:
.. Click the *Manage* button for the local graph you just created.
.. Click the *Open Folder* button.
.. Navigate to *data/databases*.
.. Copy the *yelp.db*  folder that you unzipped to *databases*.
.. Rename the *yelp.db* folder to *graph.db*.
. Start the database.
. Open Neo4j Browser for the project.

This is what you should see when you click the database icon image:{guides}/img/database-icon.png[].

image::{guides}/img/YelpLoaded.png[YelpLoaded,width=150,role=left]

{nbsp} +

Go to the next page to continue setup.

== Step 2: Verify libraries are available.

Verify that your Neo4j Browser session has access to the apoc and algo libraries by executing the Cypher below:

[source, cypher]
----
CALL dbms.procedures()
YIELD name
WHERE name STARTS WITH 'apoc.' OR name STARTS WITH 'algo'
RETURN name ORDER BY name ASC
----

{nbsp} +

If this code does not return the list of apoc and algo procedures, then you must ensure that the these libraries are available by installing the plugin (Neo4j Desktop) and restarting the database.

Go to the next page to continue setup.

== Step 3: Verify Graph Applications Playground (NEuler) is available.

In Neo4j Desktop, click the image for the Graph Applications Playground.

Does it open a new window? It should look as follows:

image::{guides}/img/NEulerInstalled.png[NEulerInstalled,width=400,role=left]

{nbsp} +

If not, you may need to reinstall it.

*Note*: This is where you should have left off in preparing your development environment for this course.

Go to the next page to continue setup.

== Step 4: Use Graph Applications Playground (NEuler) to load some more data.

In Graph Applications Playground (NEuler):

.  Click the database icon in the left pane.
.  Load the Game of Thrones data.
.  Close NEuler.
.  Open NEuler.
.  Load the European Roads data.
.  Close NEuler.

*Note*: Do not load the Twitter data as it conflicts with other data in the graph.

[start=7]
. In Neo4j Browser, confirm that your database looks as follows:

[.thumb]
image::{guides}/img/AfterNEulerLoad.png[AfterNEulerLoad,width=150]

{nbsp} +

Go to the next page to continue setup.

== Step 5: Load some additional graphs used for the exercises.

Execute each of these Cypher code blocks to add these graphs to the database:

MERGE (nBridget:Person {name:'Bridget'})
