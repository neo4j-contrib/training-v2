= Ordering Search Results

== Ordering Search Results

We want to work out which users are similar to each other so that we can show more appropriate businesses at the top of the list.
In this section we'll learn how to use the Pearson Similarity algorithm to do this.

The Pearson Similarity algorithm takes into account not only the overall similarity between users, but also their relative similarity.

== User Similarity

The query below provides a template for computing the Pearson Similarity of users based on the businesses that they've reviewed.
Update the query to:

* Compute similarity between users based on the common businesses they've reviewed (Hint: you'll need to use the `WROTE` and `REVIEWS` relationships)
* Choose a similarity cut off value (Hint: look at the `similarityCutOff` parameter)
* Choose a topK value (Hint: look at the `topK` parameter)
* Define the node and relationship projection (Hint: look at the `nodeProjection` and `relationshipProjection` parameters)

[source,cypher]
----
CALL gds.alpha.similarity.pearson(
  {data: "MATCH (u:User)
   WHERE size((u)-[:WROTE]->()) > 15
   // Fill in this part of the query
   RETURN id(u) AS item, id(business) AS category, review.stars AS weight",
   graph: "cypher", skipValue: gds.util.NaN()})

== Answer: User Similarity

This is what the query should look like:

[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.alpha.similarity.pearson.write({
  data: "MATCH (u:User)
  WHERE size((u)-[:WROTE]->()) > 15
  MATCH (u)-[:WROTE]->(review)-[:REVIEWS]->(b)
  RETURN id(u) AS item, id(b) AS category, review.stars as weight",
  graph: "cypher", topK: 5, skipValue: gds.util.NaN(), similarityCutoff: 0.1,
  nodeProjection:'*', relationshipProjection:'*'})
----

We want to use this similarity graph to improve the reviews that we show on our application.
We can find similar users by following the `SIMILAR` relationship from a user:

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (me:User {id: $userId})-[similarity:SIMILAR]->(other)
RETURN other, similarity.score AS similarity
ORDER BY similarity DESC
----

Now let's update the application to use this new information.
Instead of selecting our businesses based on the opinions of users unrelated to `user-name`, we'll show ones reviewed by similar users.
