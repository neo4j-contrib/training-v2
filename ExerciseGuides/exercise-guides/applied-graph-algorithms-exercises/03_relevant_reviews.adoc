= Finding relevant reviews

== Finding relevant reviews

We want to return relevant reviews for a business based on the user's context.
In this section we'll learn how to use the Personalized PageRank algorithm to do this.

The Personalized PageRank allows us to find influential nodes in a certain part of our graph.
We'll be using it to find influential users so that we can boost the reviews written by those users.

== Pre-load reviews graph

We're going to run the algorithm on a projected graph of users that have written reviews about the same businesses.

First, we'll select only users who have written more than 10 reviews and add a `Reviewer` label to those nodes:

[source, cypher]
----
MATCH (u:User) WHERE SIZE( (u)-[:WROTE]->() ) > 10
SET u:Reviewer
----

Then, we'll pre-load the in memory graph using the following query as we want to run the algorithm multiple times for different users:

[source, cypher]
----
CALL gds.graph.create.cypher('review-graph',
  'MATCH (u:Reviewer) RETURN id(u) AS id',
  'MATCH (u:Reviewer)-[:WROTE]->()-[:REVIEWS]->()<-[:REVIEWS]-()<-[:WROTE]-(u2:Reviewer)
   RETURN id(u) AS source, id(u2) AS target, count(*) AS weight');
----

When we run our algorithms procedures we'll need to pass in the first parameter `"review-graph"` to have the procedure run against this graph.

== Trusted users

We're going to run the algorithm in the context of a specific user, so let's first define the `userId` parameter:

[source, cypher]
----
:params userId => "Lk70TsLeGBYSXsnr5q-cXg"
----

The query below provides a template for computing Personalized PageRank for our user, where the `sourceNodes` are the users who have reviewed more than one same business as our user.
Update the query to:

* Run the algorithm against our `review-graph`
* Use the source nodes computed in the first part of the query
* Create a relationship between our user and the users returned from the procedure

[source,cypher]
----
// Compute source nodes
MATCH (u:User {id: $userId})-[:WROTE]->()-[:REVIEWS]->()<-[:REVIEWS]-()<-[:WROTE]-(other)
WITH u, other, count(*) AS count
WHERE count > 1
WITH u, collect(other) AS sourceNodes

// Execute the PageRank algorithm
CALL gds.pageRank.stream('review-graph', {
  maxIterations:5,
})

// Only keep users that have a PageRank score bigger than the default
YIELD nodeId, score
WITH u, gds.util.asNode(nodeId) AS node, score
WHERE score > 0.15 AND node <> u

// Keep up to 50 users
WITH u, node, score
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 50

// Create a relationship between our user (u) and the influential users (node)
----

== Answer: Trusted users

This is what the answer should look like:

[source,cypher]
----
// Compute source nodes
MATCH (u:User {id: $userId})-[:WROTE]->()-[:REVIEWS]->()<-[:REVIEWS]-()<-[:WROTE]-(other)
WITH u, other, count(*) AS count
WHERE count > 1
WITH u, collect(other) AS sourceNodes

// Execute the PageRank algorithm
CALL gds.pageRank.stream('review-graph', {
  maxIterations:5, sourceNodes: sourceNodes
})

// Only keep users that have a PageRank score bigger than the default
YIELD nodeId, score
WITH u, gds.util.asNode(nodeId) AS node, score
WHERE score > 0.15 AND node <> u

// Keep up to 50 users
WITH u, node, score
ORDER BY score DESC
LIMIT 50

// Create a relationship between our user (u) and the influential users (node)
MERGE (u)-[trust:TRUSTS]->(node)
SET trust.score = score
----

== Find trusted users

Now we can find the other users that our user trusts by executing the following query:

[source,cypher]
----
match (u:User {id: $userId})-[trusts:TRUSTS]->(other)
RETURN other.name, other.id, trusts.score AS score
ORDER BY score DESC
----

Now let's update the application to use this new information.
Instead of showing reviews based on the date they were written, we want to boost the reviews written by our trusted users.
