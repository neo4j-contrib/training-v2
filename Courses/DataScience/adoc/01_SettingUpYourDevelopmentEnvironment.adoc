== About this module

As a data scientist, you will create Neo4j Databases, add and update data in them, and query the data.
When you learn to use Neo4j as a data scientist, you have two options ⎼ the Neo4j Desktop or the Neo4j Sandbox.
In his module you will learn how to setup the Neo4j Sandbox for use in the rest of the course.


At the end of this module, you should be able to:
[square]
* Create a Neo4j Sandbox for learning Neo4j.
* Start using  Neo4j Browser.

The Neo4j sandbox is another way that you can begin development with Neo4j. 
It is a temporary, cloud-based instance of a Neo4j Server with its associated graph that you can access from any Web browser.
The database in a Sandbox may be blank or it may be pre-populated.
It is started automatically for you when you create the Sandbox.

By default, the Neo4j sandbox is available for three days, but you can extend it for up to 10 days. 
You must make sure that you extend your lease of the sandbox, otherwise you will lose your graph and any saved Cypher scripts you have created in the sandbox.
However, you can use Neo4j Browser Sync to save Cypher scripts from your sandbox.
The Sandbox is intended as a temporary environment or for learning about the features of Neo4j as well as specific graph use-cases.

== Steps for setting up your development environment for this training

. Start a https://neo4j.com/sandbox-v2/citations/[Neo4j Sandbox^] (use the Citations one).
The Sandbox has a Neo4j database with a pre-loaded dataset.


== *Guided Exercise: Creating a Neo4j Sandbox*

[NOTE]
In order to perform the hands-on exercises for this training, you must create a Neo4j Sandbox.

If you want to run the Neo4j Database server in the cloud using a Neo4j sandbox, follow along with this video to create a Neo4j sandbox for training purposes.
For this course, you should select the Citations sandbox.

== Using Neo4j Browser

Neo4j Browser is a tool that enables you to access a Neo4j Database by executing Cypher statements to create or update data in the graph and to query the graph to return data.
The data returned is typically visualized as nodes and relationships in a graph, but can also be displayed as tables.
In addition to executing Cypher statements, you can execute a number of system calls that are related to the database being accessed by the Browser.
For example, you can retrieve the list of queries that are currently running in the server.

You can use Neo4j Browser functionality via the web interface.
This can be accessed by specifying a URL in a Web browser using port 7474.
