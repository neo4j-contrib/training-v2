== About this module

In this module we'll learn how to build a machine learning classifier to predict co-authorships in the citation graph.

At the end of this module, you should be able to:
[square]
* Describe what link prediction is
* Use the link prediction functions in Neo4j
* Understand the challenges when building machine learning models on graph data
* Build a link prediction classifier using scikit-learn with features derived from the Neo4j Graph Algorithms library

== The Link Prediction Problem

Link prediction has been around for a long time, but was popularised by a paper written by Jon Kleinberg and David Liben-Nowell in 2004, titled https://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/kleinber/link-pred.pdf[The Link Prediction Problem for Social Networks^].

Kleinberg and Liben-Nowell approach this problem from the perspective of social networks, asking the question:

[TIP]
====
Given a snapshot of a social network, can we infer which new interactions among its members are likely to occur in the near future?
We formalize this question as the link prediction problem, and develop approaches to link prediction based on measures for analyzing the “proximity” of nodes in a network.
====

We could predict future associations between people in a terrorist network, associations between molecules in a biology network, potential co-authorships in a citation network, interest in an artist or artwork, to name just a few use cases.

In each these examples, predicting a link means that we are *predicting some future behaviour*.
For example in a citation network, we’re actually predicting the action of two people collaborating on a paper.

== Link Prediction Algorithms

Kleinberg and Liben-Nowell describe a set of methods that can be used for link prediction.
These methods compute a score for a pair of nodes, where the score could be considered a *measure of proximity* or “similarity” between those nodes based on the graph topology.
The closer two nodes are, the more likely there will be a relationship between them.

== Exercise 1: Running link prediction algorithms

Now we're going to do an exercise to get some practice at running the link prediction algorithms.
In the query edit pane of Neo4j Browser, execute the browser command: kbd:[:play data-science-exercises] and follow the instructions for the Link Prediction exercise.

== Applying Link Prediction Algorithms

We've now learnt how to execute the link prediction algorithms, but what do we do with the results?
There are two approaches:

=== Using the measures directly

We can use the scores from the link prediction algorithms directly.
With this approach we would set a threshold value above which we would predict that a pair of nodes will have a link.

For example, we might say that every pair of nodes that has a preferential attachment score above 3 would have a link, and any with 3 or less would not.

=== Supervised learning

We can take a supervised learning approach where we use the scores as features to train a binary classifier.
The binary classifier then predicts whether a pair of nodes will have a link.

In the next part of this module we're going to focus on the supervised learning approach.


== Exercise 2: Building a binary classifier

We're going to build a binary classifier to predict co-authorships using a Jupyter Notebook hosted on the Google Colaboratory environment.
We can launch the notebook by clicking on the following button.
