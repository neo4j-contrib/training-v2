== Overview

To prepare your system for this course, you must perform these four Steps:

*Step 1:* Select an Option (1,2,3) for your development environment and prepare your laptop for the selected option.

*Step 2:* Use Neo4j Browser to confirm that you can access the database.

*Step 3:* Download course files.

When performing the hands-on exercises for this training, you have three options:

*Option 1: Install and use Neo4j Desktop on your laptop (preferred approach)*
[square]
* You must download and install Neo4j Desktop before taking this training.
* You must prepare your Neo4j Desktop environment for this course.
* Neo4j Desktop is available on Windows, OS X, and Linux (must be a 64-bit system).
* Neo4j Desktop is free to use for development.
* All databases are created and used on your local system.
* You access the database with the Neo4j Browser application running locally on your system.

*Option 2: Use Neo4j Aura (Neo4j in the Cloud)*
[square]
* You must set up a Neo4j Aura subscription before taking this training.
* There is a monthly subscription cost for using Neo4j Aura.
* All operations such as backing up your database, are handled by Neo4j.
* Your databases are available 24x7 as long as your subscription is active.
* You access your database using a Web browser.

*Option 3: Use a Neo4j Sandbox (a temporary Neo4j instance)*
[square]
* You must set up a Neo4j Sandbox account before taking this training.
* A Neo4j Sandbox instance is free to use.
* Sandbox instance is available for 3 days, but can be extended to 10 days.
* You access your database using a Web browser.

Which option you use for this training will depend on your needs, but you must prepare one of them before taking this training.

== Step 1: Option 1: Using Neo4j Desktop

The Neo4j Desktop includes the Neo4j Database server which includes the graph engine and kernel so that Cypher statements can be executed to access a database on your system.
It includes an application called  Neo4j Browser.
Neo4j Browser enables you to access a Neo4j database using Cypher.
You can also call built-in procedures that communicate with the database server.
There are a number of additional libraries and drivers for accessing the Neo4j database from Cypher or from another programming language that you can install in your development environment.

Neo4j Desktop runs on OS X, Linux, and Windows.

=== Steps for setting up your development environment for this course using Neo4j Desktop

Here is an overview of the steps you will perform to set up your development environment using Neo4j Desktop:

. *Getting Started with Neo4j Desktop (follow along in video)*:
.. Download Neo4j Desktop.
... View/save the installation instructions.
.. Install Neo4j Desktop.
.. In a project, create a local graph (database) you will use for this course.
.. Start the graph.

== Step 1: Option 2: Using Neo4j Aura

include::CreateDatabaseAura.adoc[]

== Step 1: Option 3: Using a Neo4j Sandbox

include::UseSandbox.adoc[]

== Step 2: Use Neo4j Browser to confirm that you can access the database

Neo4j Browser is a tool that enables you to access a Neo4j Database by executing Cypher statements to create or update data in the graph and to query the graph to return data.
The data returned is typically visualized as nodes and relationships in a graph, but can also be displayed as tables.
In addition to executing Cypher statements, you can execute a number of system calls that are related to the database being accessed by the Browser.
For example, you can retrieve the list of queries that are currently running in the server.

There are two ways that you can use Neo4j Browser functionality:
[square]
* Use the Neo4j Browser Web interface from Neo4j Aura or Neo4j Sandbox.
* Open the Neo4j Browser application from Neo4j Desktop (database is local).

=== Getting Started with Neo4j Browser

*Note*: Before you perform the tasks shown in this video, you must have done *one* of the following:
[square]
* Created and started a database in Neo4j Desktop (Option 1).
* Created a database in Neo4j Aura (Option 2).
* Created a Blank Neo4j Sandbox (Option 3).

== Step 3: Download the course files.

You may not need all of these files for your course work, but it is a good idea to have them on your system. Download these files:
