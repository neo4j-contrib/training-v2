# Graph Academy Login

The login script for GraphAcademy resides in a S3 bucket `cdn.graphacademy.neo4j.com`.
The production built file is accessible via a public url - https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.graphacademy.neo4j.com/dist/login-prod.js

##  Description
The idea for this module is to eliminate to call `quizes.js` and `classes.js`
 and have everything in one place. This module combines Auth, Quiz, Enrollment and Classes related function.

By using the following code
```js
const graphAcademy = new GraphAcademyLogin({
	loginRedirectUrl: "..../data-science/",
	trainingClassName: "datascience",
	enrollmentUrl: "..../data-science/",
});

graphAcademy.checkSession((err, result) => {
	if(result){
		// do something
	}
});
```
## What does `checkSession` do?
ToDo: rename `checkSession` to something appopriate

The `checkSession` function does more than what the name suggests. It does this -

* Check if the user is logged in
	* If not, and `loginRedirectUrl` is set, redirect the user.
	* If yes, get enrollment status for the user
		* if not enrolled, redirect to `enrollmentUrl`
		* if enrolled and is not `courseLandingPage`
			* Get the quiz status
			* Handle QUIZ related DOM manipulation which includes
				* If summary page, display the quiz result (whethr or not all quizes have successfully taken) and attempt to fetch the certificate.
				* Attaches click event handler to the `Continue` button
					* If the quiz has already been taken, button takes to next module
					* If the quiz has not been taken, then button grades the quiz, and if pass, update the quiz status in DB and then move to the next module
				* Update the header menu to show `check icon` for quizes successfully taken
